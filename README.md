📊 Personal Expense Analysis Dashboard

🔍 Project Overview
This project transforms raw personal financial data into an interactive dashboard to uncover spending habits. It was built to demonstrate end-to-end data analysis skills—from data cleaning and categorization to visual storytelling and statistical interpretation.


🛠️ Key Features & Technical Skills:
Automated Categorization: Used advanced formulas like XLOOKUP and SUMIFS to automatically group transactions into seven core categories.
Statistical Analysis: Conducted an Average vs. Median comparison to identify a "right-skewed" spending pattern caused by high-value outliers.
Interactive Visuals: Built dynamic charts, including:
Bar Charts: For category-wise monthly summaries.
Pie Charts: To visualize the "Needs vs. Wants" distribution (50/30/20 rule analysis).
Data Cleaning: Performed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) to ensure data accuracy and consistency across all entries. 

📈 Key Insights & Conclusions:
Primary Spend Driver: Shopping was identified as the largest discretionary expense category.
Budgeting Opportunity: The analysis revealed that "Wants" (53%) slightly outweighed "Needs" (47%), highlighting a potential 15% monthly saving opportunity.
Outlier Detection: The discrepancy between the mean and median showed that rare, high-cost purchases significantly impact the overall budget more than daily habits.
